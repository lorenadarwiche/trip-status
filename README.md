# trip-status
## Project Overview
For this project, I used JGrasp as the compiler. This project uses JavaFX (a GUI for Java). What the project does is it allows you to change your "flight status" to anywhere you want to go! It includes adding your name and being able to approve or decline the change in destination! 

## How I complete the completed the project? 
1. The Professor provided most of the code as it was an assignment, however, I did have to try to debug the code and pinpoint where some issues arose when running the code. I did use [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) to help me with understanding the basics of each line of code and to understand where issues like actucally being able to click on the buttons, adding pictures to the programs, and being able to display messages properly.
