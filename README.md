# trip-status
## Project Overview
For this project, I used JGrasp as the complier. This project uses JavaFX (a GUI for Java). What the project does is it allows you to change your "flight status" to any where you want to go! It's includes adding your name and being able to approve or decline the change in destination! 

## How I complete the completed the project? 
1. The Professor provided most of the code as it was an assignment, however, I did have to try to debug the code and pinpoint where some issues arose when running the code. I did use [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) to help me with understanding the basics of each line of code and to understand where issues like actually moving the snowman and how to change the color of the buttons
