# Trip Status
## Project Overview
For this project, I used JGrasp as the compiler. This project uses JavaFX (a GUI for Java). What the project does is it allows you to change your "flight status" to anywhere you want to go! It includes adding your name and being able to approve or decline the change in destination!
